world map by thomas ballinger
pretty dumb map huh
we can use it as a template for now
 
note that connections are bidirectional; you don't actually have to
 specify any connections from a country, as long as it has connections
 to it.
Don't misspell any countries!!!
Countries can't have numbers or punctuation, and must be one word!

<start-nodeNetwork>
USA Canada Mexico
Canada Alaska USA
Mexico Cuba England USA
Cuba Mexico
England Iceland Mexico
Iceland Greenland England
Greenland Iceland Canada
Alaska Canada
<end-nodeNetwork>

This next section is optional, but it's so much better to have bonuses!
<start-bonuses>
Alaska Canada USA Mexico 4
Iceland England 2
Cuba 2

this is the width of a standard terminal (it's ok to go beyond that,
 but andrew doesn't like it)
